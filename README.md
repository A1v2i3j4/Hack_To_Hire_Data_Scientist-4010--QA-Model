# Hack_To_Hire_Data_Scientist-4010--QA-Model


Project Summary
This project involves developing a state-of-the-art question-answering system leveraging various NLP models. The objective is to create an AI system capable of understanding and generating accurate responses to user queries, simulating human-like interaction. The key models used are BERT, GPT, and T5.

Models
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Purpose: Fine-tuned for question-answering tasks.
Method: Used the bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad model, leveraging its pre-trained weights for effective fine-tuning.
Process: Tokenized the dataset, calculated start and end positions of answers, and fine-tuned the model using Hugging Face's transformers library.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

Purpose: Fine-tuned for text generation tasks.
Method: Used the gpt2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.
Process: Implemented fine-tuning with a focus on improving text generation accuracy.
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

Purpose: Employed for text generation and question-answering tasks.
Method: Fine-tuned the t5-small model to handle question-answering and text generation.
Process: Utilized Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library for model training and evaluation.
Tech Stack
Frontend:

Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook: Used for developing and running the models.
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: For creating visualizations and charts.
Backend:

Python: Main programming language used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
Transformers Library: For handling BERT, GPT, and T5 models.
Torch: Used for model training and evaluation with PyTorch backend.
Datasets Library: For handling and processing datasets.
Additional Tools and Libraries
Hugging Face Datasets: To load and preprocess the Quora Question Answer Dataset.
Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Logging: For managing and tracking code execution and debugging.
Summary
The project involved fine-tuning and evaluating multiple NLP models to develop a robust question-answering system. The models were trained on the Quora Question Answer Dataset, with the preprocessing, training, and evaluation performed using state-of-the-art libraries and tools. Visualizations and metrics were used to assess model performance and provide insights for further improvements.
